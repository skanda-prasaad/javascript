Challenge 1
Instructions:

Create a function called getCelsius() that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as an argument and returns the temperature in celsius.

For bonus points, write it as a one line arrow function

Expected Result:

console.log(getCelsius(32)); // 0
You can make the output look prettier by putting it into a string. You can even add \xB0 (degrees) and a C in front of the celsius temperature.

console.log(`The temperature is ${getCelsius(32)} \xB0C`);
// The temperature is 0 Â°C



Challenge 2 :-


Instructions:

Create an arrow function called minMax() that takes in an array of numbers and returns an object with the minimum and maximum numbers in the array.

Expected Result:

console.log(minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));
// { min: 1, max: 5 }
